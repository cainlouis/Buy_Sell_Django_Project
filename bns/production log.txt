1. in manage.py shell: to query for all posts ofa user:
    user.post_set.all() - in this case post is the name of the model, could be anything.
    user is User.objects.filter(username='student').first()
    Happens because author in the Post model is a foreign key to the User model

    dog.shelter_set.all() would display all dogs from the shelter, if set up correctly
2. Ask Laurent about 4 apps of Apocalypse (admin is a separate app???)
